DOGC,t,"Fish appear to be able to access lower 11 km of river up to Williams Lake: Sockeye, coho, (pink) noted in Williams Lake River in 1997 watershed planning profiles. All fish passage to upper watershed blocked by outlet dam on Williams Lake."
EUCL,t,"Chinook captured in Euchiniko Lake in 1985 (Dollighan, 1985) were believed to be resident, based on a 10 m waterfall 4 km upstream from the mouth of Westroad River. However, Chinook from the Westroad stock were captured in the Albion test fishery (lower Fraser River) in 2000 and 2001. Anecdotal notes from flyfishermen also state that chinook migrate from the ocean into the Westroad system. "

TUTR,t,This is a remote and under-studied watershed. Steelhead records are old and could not be verified. Keep it in for now.
